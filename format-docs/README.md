## Defined formats:
* [Pick](Pick.md) Format - A format for unassociated picks from a
waveform arrival time picking algorithm.
* [Beam](Beam.md) Format  - A format for unassociated beams from seismic
array beamforming algorithm.
* [Correlation](Correlation.md) Format - A format to contain a seismic
event detection made using a cross correlation algorithm.
* [Detection](Detection.md) Format - A format to contain a seismic event detection
made using an event detection algorithm.
* [Retract](Retract.md) Format - A format to contain a seismic event
retraction made using an event detection algorithm.

## Supporting objects:
* [Hypocenter](Hypocenter.md) Object - An object that contains information about
a hypocenter as part of a detection.
* [Amplitude](Amplitude.md) Object - An object that contains information about
an amplitude as part of a pick.
* [Associated](Associated.md) Object - An object that contains associated
information if a pick, beam, or correlation is included in an detection.
* [Filter](Filter.md) Object - An object that contains filter information as
part of a pick.
* [Site](Site.md) Object - An object that defines the station used to create a
pick, beam, correlation.
* [Source](Source.md) Object - An object that defines the creator/source of a
pick, beam, correlation, or detection.
