## Defined formats:
* [PickJSON](PickJSON.md) Format - A format for unassociated picks from a
waveform arrival time picking algorithm.
* [BeamJSON](BeamJSON.md) Format  - A format for unassociated beams from seismic
array beamforming algorithm.
* [CorrelationJSON](CorrelationJSON.md) Format - A format to contain a seismic
event detection made using a cross correlation algorithm.
* [OriginJSON](OriginJSON.md) Format - A format to contain a seismic event origin
made using an event detection algorithm.
* [RetractJSON](RetractJSON.md) Format - A format to contain a seismic event
retraction made using an event detection algorithm.

## Supporting objects:
* [Amplitude](Amplitude.md) Object - An object that contains information about
an amplitude as part of a pick.
* [Associated](Associated.md) Object - An object that contains associated
information if a pick, beam, or correlation is included in an origin.
* [Filter](Filter.md) Object - An object that contains filter information as
part of a pick.
* [Site](Site.md) Object - An object that defines the station used to create a
pick, beam, correlation,
* [Source](Source.md) Object - An object that defines the creator/source of a
pick, beam, correlation, or origin
